Then we made some basic plots to visualize (1) the average level of activity across the population and (2) the distribution of ISIs for an individual neuron. In the very last bit, we started to think about using mathematical formalisms to understand or explain some physiological phenomenon. All of this only allowed us to understand \"What\" the data looks like.\n",
